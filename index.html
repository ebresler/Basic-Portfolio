            <p>My name is Eli Bresler and I was born on December 13, 1994 in San Francisco, California. I moved to
                Philadelphia, Pennsylvania when I was 14 and decided to go to college in Colorado. Now I'm back living
                in San Francisco, after a long and epic journey westward from the City of Brotherly Love.
                Asside from becoming a rockstar web developer, I spend my time playing soccer, cooking, and hanging out
                with friends.

            <p>This is a really short and weird paragraph to write about myself and I have completely run out of things to say. 
                At this point, I'm just going to let you click around and see if you like my first site! I hope you enjoy my portfolio
                of my favorite Tottenham Hotspur players (best team in the world... COME ON YOU SPURS!)
