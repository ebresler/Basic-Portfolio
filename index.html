            <p>My name is Eli Bresler and I was born on December 13, 1994 in San Francisco, California. I moved to
                Philadelphia, Pennsylvania when I was 14 and decided to go to college in Colorado. Now I'm back living
                in San Francisco, after a long and epic journey westward from the City of Brotherly Love.
                Asside from becoming a rockstar web developer, I spend my time playing soccer, cooking, and hanging out
                with friends.
            </p>

            <p>This is a really short and weird paragraph to write about myself and I'm doing it all in one sitting and
                have completely run out of things to say. At this point, I'm just going to let you click around and see
                if you like my first site!
